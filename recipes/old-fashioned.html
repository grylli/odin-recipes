            Probably the oldest cocktail that was called a "cocktail", the Old Fashioned is a straightforward, easy-to-make and easy-to-drink cocktail with lots of flexibility. As long as you have a glass and the ingredients, you can make an Old Fashioned!

            Old Fashioneds are such a simple formula that they're robust to easy changes. Swap your whiskey for brandy, or maybe use maple syrup instead of sugar. The possibilities are endless!

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 oz American whiskey</li>
            <li>1 tsp granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 dashes Angostura bitters</li>
            <li>1 swathe orange peel</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare your garnish. Use a peel to remove a piece of skin from an orange. Take care to remove as little pith - the white stuff - as possible.</li>
            <li>Put your sugar into your glass.</li>
            <li>Shake 2 dashes of bitters onto the sugar. Stir until sugar is coated by the bitters.</li>
            <li>Measure and pour your whiskey on top of the sugar-bitters mixture.</li>
            <li>Build a good amount of ice into your glass. Stir for 5-10 seconds.</li>
            <li>Squeeze your orange peel over the top of the drink, then twist and place inside.</li>
            <li>Serve!</li>
        </ol>
